# Arithmetic Arranger - freeCodeCamp Project

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Arithmetic Arranger" challenge, one of the five projects required for the "Scientific Computing with Python" certification from freeCodeCamp.

The script contains a function `arithmetic_arranger` that takes a list of arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) and formats them vertically, side-by-side, as you would see them on a piece of paper. It also includes an option to display the answers to these problems.

## Key Concepts and Skills Learned

This project was an opportunity to practice and demonstrate several fundamental Python skills:

*   **String Manipulation:** Extensive use of string methods like `.split()`, `.rjust()`, and `.join()` to format the output correctly.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust checks to validate input data, such as the number of problems, the type of operator, and the format of the numbers.
*   **List and Loop Management:** Iterating through the list of problems and appending formatted strings to several lists, which are then joined together to produce the final output.
*   **Conditional Logic:** Using `if/else` statements to handle different scenarios, including the optional display of answers.
*   **Basic Algorithm Design:** Planning the logic to correctly calculate the width of each problem and align the numbers and operators.

## How to Run the Project

1.  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2.  Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4.  The `main.py` file (or equivalent) contains the function definition and an example of its usage. You can run it directly to see a sample output:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    *(Note: You might need to rename your file to `main.py` for this command to work)*
